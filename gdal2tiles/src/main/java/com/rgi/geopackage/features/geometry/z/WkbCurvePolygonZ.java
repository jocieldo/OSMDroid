// TODO - this class shouldn't be abstract, but there's some confusion here.
// OGC 06-103r4 (OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information
// - Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture) lists CurvePolygon
// as for "future use". Wikipedia's article says that CurvePolygons are based
// on CircularString, and the GeoPackage spec says they're based on "Curve". In
// any event, this type is a GeoPackage extension geometry type. It's only
// included because the spec object diagram and Annex E suggests that Polygon
// (a core type) is based on CurvePolygon which is additionally confusing.
